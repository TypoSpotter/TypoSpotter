** Finite Element Analyst/Engineer with script-writing ability **

I got a degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1999, and then have worked in engineering simulation ever since. Over the years I have discovered my ability to understand scripts and Linux systems has been of value to my work and the work of my colleagues: debugging scripts that were not working as intended and writing new scripts to automate tedious and repetitive tasks.
